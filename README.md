# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-with-R


This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Downloading the dataset.
2. Loading the fetures and activity information.
3. Loading training and test datasets from the directory, and keeping the columns that are meaningful to us( Mean and Standard Deviation)
4. Loading the subject and activity data set from the dataset, and merging the two datasets together.
5. Creating a new dataset that only consists of the average mean value of each varibale for subject and activity pair.
6. Finally creating a file called tidy.txt.
